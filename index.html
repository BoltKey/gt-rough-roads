		<div id='help-text'>This is an expansion app for board game Galaxy Trucker. Before each flight, using the + button, reveal any number of cards that adjust the rules for the whole flight (we recommend using 1-3 cards for each flight). If you don't like a particular card, discard it with the ✕. Click any card to enlarge it. <br> At the top of the screen, you see how many cards are remaining in the deck. At the bottom, you see how many cards are in the discard.</div>
